## Deployment

If you want to deploy the BlueFramework you have to build the “DEPLOY” project. This project requires an installation of the Windows Installer XML (WIX). Currently (at the time of writing this) we are using Windows Installer XML 3.11.1 which can be downloaded [here](http://wixtoolset.org/releases/).

**Open Questions**

* Why does the INSTALL project not handle this?
* Why is the name of the project DEPLOY and not Deploy?
